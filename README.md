## 🙆‍♀️「私について」 About Me
* I'm currently expanding my technical acumen, pursuing my Bachelor of IT (Double Major) at 🎓Murdoch University: <br>
&emsp; 1. 💻Computer Science <br>
&emsp; 2. 🎮Games Software Design & Production <br>
* 🔊 With 10 years of audio design, I've been fine-tuning my skills to bring immersive auditory experiences to life across various platforms, including short films, TVCs, and 2 local movies. <br>
* 🎧 Specialising in Game Audio, Steinberg Nuendo, and Wwise, I have a passion for sound that not only enhances gameplay but also tells a captivating story. My role encompasses a diverse range of tasks – from the creation and integration of audio assets to debugging audio challenges. But what I love most about my job is the opportunity to creatively use technology to enhance sound and tackle complex problems. <br>
* ❤️ Looking forward, my aim is to merge my knowledge and experience, blending technological insights with an artistic vision to create unique experiences and innovative solutions. <br>
